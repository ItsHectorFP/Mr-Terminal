# 👋 Hi, I’m @Mr-Terminal. You can call me Hector.
I am a High School Senior who likes computers, technology, and video games! I also like music and open-source software!

Computers, software, and technology is a field that I'm intrested in since I was a little boy. Ever since I touched a Windows XP computer back in Elementry school and touched an Android smartphone in the early 2010s, it was an interesting and curious place to be. Android was in it's infancy, Windows was new to me, software was fun to use, hardware was interesting to look at, etc., it's pretty much me exploring a lot of things technology. It was amazing!

To this day, it still is amazing. Even though my happy childhood is now in the past, the small instict of a little kid is still inside me. And that is curosity. Even though I'm at high school, I still want to explore the uncharted realm of technology. HTML, CSS, Android, Linux, open-source technology, there's so much to explore! And I'm just scratching the surface.

I also make artwork from time to time. I use Source Filmmaker and Blender to create my artworks. While they may not be in a professional quality, at least that's what I assume, that's the level you are seeing right now. I do it because it's a passion of myself.

There's so much I want to say, but I don't know if I can say it in words! You'll understand me one you get to see my contents. 

# 👀 I’m interested in ...
Creating video games, making music and sound, modeling 3D objects, creating textures and sprites. Later on, I'm also interested in digging in the software files to see, for example, how they work.

# 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
HTML and CSS (and Markdown code as well). I also want to learn how to do JavaScript and React sometime in the not-to-distant future. After all, the first thing I want to do is build a website using my own code so I can release it to the public so everyone, including you, can use it! Everyone wins!

# 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
None at the moment. I'm quite nervous on collaboration because it's something I haven't done yet in an online world. Maybe I'll start something small for the time being.

# 📫 How to reach me ...
Currently, I won't offer any email addresses or links to reach out to me.
