# Welcome to the Wizkid Terminal Website!
Home of the finest (or the not-so-finest) content on the internet. The *modus operandi* of the Wizkid Project is to share stuff on the internet without any commerical restriction. No moentization, no paywalls, no BS. Just the stuff I share.

Along with that, I will be sharing content that is under free liences. Yep! Stuff like Creative Commons, MIT, Unliense, and many others. Heck, I'll even release the project files, for free! Does your favorite content creator does that? Very unlikely.

## *Who are you?*
My name is Hector Flores-Pena. I am a high school senior living in the good ol' state of Georgia. 18 years old. I like making artworks, listening to music, playing games, and cars. Is that enough? Probably not, because I have a bunch to say at my disposal, but it would be silly to list them all. Thus, this is what you'll get out of me.

## *What do you do for a living?*
There's a bunch of things I can do for a living, but since I have my own skills and abliites, I'll list a few:
- Pictures and animations using Source Filmmaker.
- Video editing using Audacity.
- Playing video games. You know, *Asphalt*, *Real Racing 3*, *Double Action: Boogaloo*, *NASCAR '15*, and many others. In broad terms, I play a bunch of FPS, racing, and puzzle games.
- Listening to music. No, not the popular stuff of today! But the good ones of the modern and classic era. Like electronic and dance music. Video game soundtracks as well.
- Linux. Used to have a Debian- or Ubuntu-based OS. Now I have an Arch-based distro! Speciffaly, Manjaro Linux. Arch is the best! *(Don't worry, I have Windows 11. Don't think I ditch Windows all the way. After all, it is the powerhouse for a bunch of things.)*

You got that? That's peer reviewed.

## *Why are you doing this?*
Like I said before, I want to share stuff on the internet without any commerical restrictions. Why bother spending money if you can get the stuff for free? That's my aim here. Make stuff, share stuff, release stuff. All for free without the need to spend a single dime. That's my gratitude. You can keep your money now.

## *OK, if you are sharing stuff for free, how are you going to get money?*
Simple. Donations. I'll set up a PayPal and/or a Patreon soon so I get funds to keep the Wizkid Project going. It sounds silly since this is a one-man project, but it would be nice incase something happens, like my computer's battery being dead or upgrades for my laptop or a setup. You know, the usual.

For now, I won't be accepting donations at this time.

## *What programs will you be using?*
Here's a summary of the programs I'll be using for the project.
- **Audio & Video:** Audacity, Kdenlive, HitFilm Express, OBS Studio, GIMP.
- **Animations & Stills:** Source Filmmaker, Blender, Bforartists.
- **Code:** Visual Studio Code, Markdown Editor.
- **Documents:** LibreOffice, Google Docs.
- **Notes:** CherryTree, Microsoft OneNote.
- **Operating Systems:** Windows 11, Manjaro Linux.
- **Others:** VTFEdit.

Sounds a lot, eh? Yep. That's what I use.
